Robot Wars

This Program involves a server and multiple TCP clients (Up to 4 if I remember correctly)

Start the server by navigating to the Server folder and running

javac *.java

java Server

(This server will run on localhost port 8000 you can use ngrok (An amazing tool found at ngrok.com) to make it a public server)

-You can find your private ip in settings and use that in the client java file if you are running it on another computer on the network.

Start the Client by navigating to the Client Folder and running

javac *java

java Client

Highscores do not work yet and you need two clients to submit their names before the game will start
